#Moving Box to the Right
This program creates a box starting at the coordinates (0, 0).
After that, it enters a loop where the box is erased and redrawn at a new position—for example (01, 00), (02, 00), (03, 00), and so on.

The x-axis increases by 1 each step, making the box move smoothly to the right across the screen
